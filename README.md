As a junior data analyst within Cyclistic's marketing analytics team, I'm currently participating in a project to identify growth opportunities through customer segmentation.

Instead of solely focusing on acquiring new customers, the director of marketing, Moreno requested to analyze the behavior of existing customer segments – annual members and casual riders. By understanding their distinct behaviors, to develop a targeted marketing strategy that converts casual riders into loyal annual members. 

Following the established data analysis process – Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act – I am going to leverage customer data to gain insights and build a conversion strategy for casual riders.
